The power of Open Source! :metal:

I use [an app](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu) for MacOS to show information about the music I'm currently playing in Spotify. This app is Open Sourced and the source code is available on GitHub.

I was checking the project evolution on GitHub and stumbled upon an open [issue about language localisation of the app](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu/issues/44) and I realized that there was no Portugues translation, so I forked the repository, cloned it to my machine and opened my text editor and started translating the text strings. Not much more than 15 minutes later (it is a simple app, not much to translate) I had everything translated, commited and ready to be merged into the original repo.
