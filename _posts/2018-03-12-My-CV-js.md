title: My interactiva CV HTML page with JS
---

Today I was fixing up my CV page, which is a static HTML file.

I was in the shower, when I got the idea to add a little "interactivity" to the page: a URL GET parameter that would encode the *target* company, and display a "hire me" message.

30 minutes of hacking later, here is the result:

Here is how:

1. I get the URL GEt parameters

and

2. Then, if there is detected an URL GET Param, I add a new element to thw "Work Experience" section with the name of the *target* company and a button with a *mailto* link.


and then add it to the page
