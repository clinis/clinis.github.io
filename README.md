# [clinis.github.io](https://clinis.github.io)

My personal webpage (and, possibly, Blog) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Jekyll Now theme](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).


## GitHub Pages

As a GitHub user, you’re "entitled" to one free user website, which will live at `https://yourusername.github.io`. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll.


### Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a website generator that’s designed for building minimal, static blogs, with all of the content hosted and version-controlled on GitHub. The goal was to eliminate the complexity of other blogging platforms by creating a workflow that allows you to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).


### Jekyll Now

[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

#### Jekyll Now Features

- [x] Fully responsive and mobile optimized base theme (**[theme demo](http://jekyllnow.com)**);  
- [x] Sass/Coffeescript support using Jekyll 2.0;  
- [x] Disqus commenting;  
- [x] Google Analytics integration;  
- [x] SVG social icons for your footer.


## Getting Started

Local Development:

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop with `gem install github-pages`.
This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.;
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/clinis/clinis.github.io.git`;
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes with `jekyll serve`;
4. View your website at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/);
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
